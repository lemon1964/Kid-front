# Kid Project

## Project Description

**Kid** is an educational project created to demonstrate web development skills, including a frontend built with **React** and **Next.js**, and a backend built with **Django DRF**, integrated with services like **Stripe**, **ЮKassa**, and **Brevo**. The project features interactive educational tasks for children, such as quizzes, drag-and-drop tasks, and graphical tasks with animations.

The **Kid** project meets the requirements of the [**Full Stack Web Development** course at the University of Helsinki](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/blob/master/project.md). The project uses **Next.js** for the frontend, providing an additional step to enhance performance and SEO. For the backend, **Django REST Framework** was chosen, showcasing proficiency with another technology stack.

### Project Features:

1. **Using Next.js**:
   - **Kid** was implemented using **Next.js**, a framework that offers additional features like server-side rendering and static page generation, which improves performance and SEO. I self-learned Next.js, diving into features of the framework not covered in the course materials.
   
2. **Backend with Django DRF**:
   - In the **Kid** project, the backend is built using **Django REST Framework**. This is a different stack that excels at API development. Django offers a powerful ecosystem and tools for rapid development, including an admin panel and support for various databases. Full functionality for user authentication, payment handling, and various API endpoints for frontend interaction have been implemented.
   - **Django DRF** was chosen for its flexibility and stability, which accelerated development and provided a secure and efficient API for the frontend.

### Functionality:
- **Interactive Tasks**: Quizzes, drag-and-drop tasks, and animations to develop logic and visual perception.
- **Authentication**: User authentication via **NextAuth** with Google login support.
- **Payments**: Integration with **Stripe** and **ЮKassa** for one-time purchases and subscriptions.
- **Deployment**: The app is deployed on **Render** with **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment.

### Notes

1. This project was developed to demonstrate proficiency in frontend development using Next.js and backend development using Django REST Framework. The project covers all major stages of development, from setting up the basic framework to integrating with external services like Brevo, Stripe, and ЮKassa.
   
2. A notification from **Render** has been received: "Your free Render PostgreSQL database, baby, will be suspended on 2025-04-07. The database will become unavailable on that date unless you upgrade to a paid instance." I will explore the possibility of deploying my own database via Docker or another solution.
